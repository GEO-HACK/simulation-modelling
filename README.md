Simulation Modeling

Queue Simulation

This project implements a basic queue simulation model in Python using the heapq module for event handling and random module for simulating interarrival and service times.

Features:

Simulates a queue system with arrival and departure events.

Uses an exponential distribution to model interarrival and service times.

Maintains an event list for scheduling arrivals and departures.

Computes queue statistics such as average waiting time and utilization.
